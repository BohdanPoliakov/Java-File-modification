# Task:
Develop a program that modifies a text file by formatting the text in a given file as follows:  
1) Align all lines of text to the centre (similar to what Word does with Format -> Paragraph -> Center Text). To format the text, increase the number of space characters at the beginning and end of the line. You can have one less space character at the end of a line (be sure to add spaces at the end of lines as well).
2) Delete blank lines, each line must start with a capital letter.
3) Insert a blank line between every two lines.
4) The length of the lines of text in the resulting file must be chosen according to the length of the longest line of text.

# User interface requirements:
The program must handle print, format and exit queries. Until the user enters the exit command, the program must enter the commands and execute the corresponding actions in an infinite loop.

Command format:

-print filename

-format filename

-exit

# It is forbidden to modify files in the "files" folder.
